## ⚠️ Important Compliance Notes

1. **FTC Disclosure Required:** Add affiliate disclosure to every page with affiliate links. Example: *"This post contains affiliate links. We may earn a commission at no extra cost to you."*
2. **Already have it?** Check that `about.html` and individual articles include disclosure language.
3. **Amazon Specific:** Must include: *"As an Amazon Associate I earn from qualifying purchases."*
4. **Credit Cards:** Must include rate/fee disclaimers when mentioning specific APRs or rewards.
5. **No Guarantees:** Never guarantee returns on investments or savings rates (they change).

---

## Notes

- **Vanguard** has no traditional affiliate program; use a direct non-affiliate link
- **Schwab** affiliate availability varies; check CJ and Impact
- If **meal kit** programs reject you, most offer personal referral credits ($40–$60 off for referrals) — these can serve as temporary placeholders
- **CardRatings** is the realistic path for credit card monetization on a new site; direct issuer programs (Chase, Amex, Citi) require significant traffic
- Consider **Skimlinks** (https://skimlinks.com) as a "set and forget" tool that auto-affiliates plain links to 48,000+ merchants — good for the generic `[AFFILIATE_LINK]` placeholders
