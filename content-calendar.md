## PART 1: Existing Content SEO Audit

### Current Articles (10 posts)

| # | Article | Word Count | Affiliate Links | SEO Score | Notes |
|---|---------|-----------|----------------|-----------|-------|
| 1 | Best Free Budgeting Apps 2026 | ~2,260 | 14 | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Strong buying-intent keyword. Good H2 structure, meta tags, OG tags. Comparison table is great for conversions. |
| 2 | Best High Yield Savings Accounts 2026 | ~1,870 | 16 | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Excellent monetization keyword. Good rate comparisons. Could add a "best for" summary table at top. |
| 3 | Build Credit Score 0 to 700 | ~1,620 | 24 | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Highest affiliate link density. Great for credit card affiliate programs. Timeline format is engaging. |
| 4 | Debt Payoff Strategies for Beginners | ~1,960 | 15 | ⭐⭐⭐ | Informational intent — harder to monetize. Could add product recommendations (debt payoff apps, balance transfer cards). |
| 5 | Emergency Fund Calculator | ~1,680 | 22 | ⭐⭐⭐ | Good tool-based content. Could embed an actual calculator widget for engagement. |
| 6 | Emergency Fund: How Much You Need | ~2,325 | 14 | ⭐⭐⭐ | Overlaps with #5 — consider merging or differentiating more clearly. Mostly informational. |
| 7 | First-Time Home Buyer Savings Plan | ~1,660 | 21 | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | High-value niche (mortgage affiliates pay $50-200+ per lead). Good structure. |
| 8 | How to Save Money on Groceries | ~1,800 | 15 | ⭐⭐⭐ | High traffic potential but low affiliate revenue. Could add cashback app recommendations. |
| 9 | How to Start Investing with $100 | ~1,450 | 18 | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Strong buying intent for investing platforms. Good for brokerage affiliate links. |
| 10 | Side Hustles That Actually Pay 2026 | ~1,590 | 19 | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Evergreen viral potential. Good platform affiliate opportunities. |

### Overall SEO Strengths
- ✅ All articles have meta descriptions, OG tags, Twitter cards
- ✅ Good keyword placement in titles and H1s
- ✅ Canonical URLs set
- ✅ Consistent site structure and navigation
- ✅ Affiliate link placeholders already integrated

### SEO Weaknesses & Opportunities
- ❌ No schema markup (Article, FAQ, HowTo) — adding this would boost rich snippet chances
- ❌ Two emergency fund articles cannibalize each other — consolidate or add distinct long-tail targeting
- ❌ No internal linking strategy between articles (e.g., budgeting apps → investing article)
- ❌ Missing alt text on images (can't verify without images, but likely missing)
- ❌ No FAQ sections — these drive featured snippets and People Also Ask appearances
- ❌ Content is heavily informational — need more **buying-intent** articles ("best X for Y")

## PART 4: Publishing Strategy

### Posting Schedule
- **Weeks 1-3:** Publish 2 articles/week (highest-priority buying-intent content)
- **Weeks 4-10:** Publish 1-2 articles/week (fill out content gaps)
- **Ongoing:** Update existing articles monthly with current rates/prices

### Internal Linking Plan
Every new article should link to 2-3 existing articles:
- Meal Kit article → links to "Save Money on Groceries" and "Budgeting Apps"
- Robo-Advisors → links to "Start Investing with $100" and "High Yield Savings"
- Cashback Credit Cards → links to "Build Credit Score" and "Debt Payoff Strategies"

### Monetization Priority
1. **Credit cards** — highest CPA ($50-200+)
2. **Financial products** (loans, insurance, robo-advisors) — high CPA ($30-150)
3. **Fintech apps** (meal kits, money transfer, budgeting) — volume-based ($5-30)
4. **Amazon Associates** (books, budget tools) — low CPA but easy to add

### SEO Quick Wins for Existing Content
1. Add FAQ schema to all articles
2. Add comparison tables with affiliate CTAs at the top of "best X" articles
3. Create internal link web between all articles
4. Add "Last updated: [date]" to show freshness
5. Submit updated sitemap to Google Search Console
