It lets you start investing with just $5 and automatically rounds up your everyday purchases to invest the spare change. For example, a $3.75 coffee becomes $4.00, and the extra $0.25 goes into a diversified portfolio. Over time, these micro-investments add up significantly without requiring you to think about investing."

All the apps on our list are registered with FINRA (Financial Industry Regulatory Authority) and are SIPC-insured, which protects your securities up to $500,000 and cash up to $250,000 if the brokerage fails. They also use bank-level encryption (256-bit SSL) and two-factor authentication to protect your account. That said, your investments can still lose value due to market fluctuations — SIPC protects against brokerage failure, not investment losses."

However, diversified index funds and ETFs — which most beginner apps use — spread risk across hundreds or thousands of companies, reducing the chance of catastrophic loss. Historically, the S&P 500 has returned an average of 10% per year over the long term, despite short-term dips. The key for beginners is to invest consistently, diversify, and think long-term (5+ years)."

You deposit money and the algorithm handles everything — asset allocation, rebalancing, and tax-loss harvesting. Trading apps like Webull give you full control to buy and sell individual stocks, ETFs, options, and crypto yourself. Robo-advisors are better for hands-off beginners who want to set it and forget it. Trading apps are better for those who want to learn about markets and make their own investment decisions."

The most important thing is consistency, not the amount. A good rule of thumb is to invest 10-15% of your income for retirement. If that's not feasible right now, start with $50-$100/month and increase as your income grows. Many apps like Acorns and SoFi let you set up automatic recurring investments so you never forget."

Acorns charges a flat monthly fee of $3-$12 depending on the plan. Betterment charges 0.25% annually on your balance (so $25/year on a $10,000 portfolio). M1 Finance and Fidelity are completely free for basic investing. When comparing fees, look at the total cost relative to your portfolio size — a $3/month fee on a $500 portfolio is 7.2% annually, which is very expensive. As your balance grows, percentage-based fees become more relevant."

They make it easy to start with small amounts and learn as you go. As your portfolio grows past $50,000+, you may want to switch to or add a full-service brokerage like Fidelity or Schwab for access to more investment options, advanced tools, retirement planning services, and potentially lower fees at scale. Many investors use both — an app for casual investing and a brokerage for retirement accounts."

                        <p>You don't need thousands of dollars or a finance degree to start investing. In 2026, the best investment apps let you begin with as little as $1, offer commission-free trades, and provide built-in education to help you learn as you grow. The hardest part isn't picking the right app — it's just getting started.</p>

                        <p>I've tested every major investment app over the past year, comparing fees, features, ease of use, and educational resources. Whether you want a hands-off robo-advisor that does everything automatically or a trading app where you pick your own stocks, this guide ranks the 8 best options for beginners and helps you choose the right one for your goals.</p>

                        <div style="background: #f0f7ff; border-left: 4px solid #2563eb; padding: 1.5rem; margin: 2rem 0; border-radius: 0 8px 8px 0;">
                            <strong>💡 Quick Pick:</strong> Start with <!-- AFFILIATE: acorns --><strong>Acorns</strong> if you want completely hands-off micro-investing ($5 minimum). Choose <!-- AFFILIATE: sofi-invest --><strong>SoFi Invest</strong> if you want a free all-in-one platform with financial planning. Pick <!-- AFFILIATE: betterment --><strong>Betterment</strong> if you want the best robo-advisor with automatic portfolio management.

                        <h2>Why Use an Investment App? (vs. Traditional Brokerage)</h2>

                        <p>Investment apps have democratized access to the stock market. Just 10 years ago, opening a brokerage account required $500–$2,500 minimum deposits and $7–$10 per trade commissions. Today, apps like SoFi and Public.com let you invest $1 with zero commissions.</p>

                        <h3>What Makes an App "Beginner-Friendly"?</h3>

                        <p>Not all investment platforms are created equal for newcomers. The best beginner apps share these traits:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Low or no minimums:</strong> Start with $1–$10, not $500+</li>
                            <li><strong>Fractional shares:</strong> Buy a slice of Amazon or Tesla instead of paying $3,000+ for a full share</li>
                            <li><strong>Built-in education:</strong> In-app lessons, articles, and community features that teach as you invest</li>
                            <li><strong>Simple interface:</strong> Clean design that doesn't overwhelm with charts and jargon</li>
                            <li><strong>Automatic investing:</strong> Set-and-forget options that invest on your schedule</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>How Much Money Do You Need to Start?</h3>

                        <p>Less than you think. Here's what each app requires:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>$0:</strong> Webull, Public.com, Fidelity — open an account and deposit any amount</li>
                            <li><strong>$1:</strong> SoFi Invest — buy fractional shares of stocks and ETFs</li>
                            <li><strong>$5:</strong> Acorns — start micro-investing with round-ups</li>
                            <li><strong>$10:</strong> Betterment, Stash — robo-advisor and guided investing</li>
                            <li><strong>$100:</strong> M1 Finance — build custom portfolio "pies"</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>If you've already got an <a href="emergency-fund-how-much-you-need.html">emergency fund</a> of at least $500–$1,000, you're ready to start investing. If not, focus on building that safety net first with a <a href="best-high-yield-savings-accounts-2026.html">high-yield savings account</a>.</p>

                        <h2>How We Ranked These Investment Apps</h2>

                        <h3>Evaluation Criteria</h3>

                        <p>We scored each app across six categories on a 10-point scale:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Fees & costs (25%):</strong> Monthly fees, trading commissions, expense ratios, and hidden charges</li>
                            <li><strong>Minimum balance (15%):</strong> How little you need to get started</li>
                            <li><strong>Educational resources (20%):</strong> Quality and depth of learning materials</li>
                            <li><strong>Ease of use (15%):</strong> App design, onboarding experience, and navigation</li>
                            <li><strong>Investment options (15%):</strong> Stocks, ETFs, crypto, bonds, IRAs, fractional shares</li>
                            <li><strong>Automation features (10%):</strong> Auto-investing, round-ups, rebalancing, and recurring deposits</li>
                        </ul>

You can always start passive and add active investing later.</p>

                        <p>A seemingly small 1% fee can cost you over $100,000 in lost returns over 30 years on a $500/month investment. Here's how fees compare:</p>

                            <li><strong>Free ($0):</strong> SoFi, M1 Finance, Webull, Public, Fidelity</li>
                            <li><strong>Low (0.25%/year):</strong> Betterment ($25/year on $10K)</li>
                            <li><strong>Flat fee ($3–$12/month):</strong> Acorns, Stash — reasonable once your balance exceeds $5,000+</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Check for Fractional Shares</h3>
                        <p>Fractional shares let you invest in expensive stocks like Amazon ($180+), Google ($170+), or Berkshire Hathaway ($600,000+) with as little as $1. All 8 apps on our list support fractional shares, but coverage varies. SoFi, Public, and Fidelity offer the broadest fractional share access.</p>

                        <h3>Look at Educational Resources</h3>
                        <p>The best investment is in your financial education. Apps with strong learning resources:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>SoFi:</strong> Free certified financial planner access + in-app articles</li>
                            <li><strong>Webull:</strong> Paper trading simulator + market analysis tools</li>
                            <li><strong>Public:</strong> Community discussions + live expert events</li>
                            <li><strong>Fidelity:</strong> Learning Center with courses, webinars, and articles</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h2>Common Beginner Investing Mistakes to Avoid</h2>

                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Trying to time the market:</strong> Even professional fund managers can't do this consistently. Invest regularly regardless of market conditions (dollar-cost averaging).</li>
                            <li><strong>Investing before building an emergency fund:</strong> Keep 3–6 months of expenses in a <a href="best-high-yield-savings-accounts-2026.html">high-yield savings account</a> before investing. You don't want to sell investments at a loss because of an unexpected car repair.</li>
                            <li><strong>Checking your portfolio daily:</strong> Markets fluctuate. Checking daily leads to panic selling. Set a monthly or quarterly review schedule.</li>
                            <li><strong>Investing money you'll need within 5 years:</strong> If you need the money for a down payment in 2 years, keep it in savings. The stock market is for money you won't touch for 5+ years.</li>
                            <li><strong>Putting all your money in one stock:</strong> Diversification is the only "free lunch" in investing. Use ETFs or diversified portfolios to spread risk.</li>
                            <li><strong>Ignoring fees on small balances:</strong> A $3/month fee on a $500 balance is 7.2% annually — more than your expected returns. Use free apps until your balance grows.</li>
                            <li><strong>Following social media stock tips:</strong> By the time you hear about a "hot stock" on TikTok, the opportunity has passed. Stick to your plan.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h2>FAQs About Investment Apps</h2>

                        <div style="background: #f9fafb; border-radius: 8px; padding: 2rem; margin: 2rem 0;">
                            <h3 style="margin-top: 0;">What is the best investment app for beginners with little money?</h3>
                            <p>Acorns is the best investment app for beginners with very little money. It lets you start investing with just $5 and automatically rounds up your everyday purchases to invest the spare change. SoFi Invest is the best free option, letting you buy fractional shares starting at $1 with zero fees.</p>

                            <h3>Are investment apps safe?</h3>
                            <p>Yes, reputable investment apps are safe. All the apps on our list are registered with FINRA and are SIPC-insured, which protects your securities up to $500,000 and cash up to $250,000 if the brokerage fails. They also use bank-level encryption and two-factor authentication. However, SIPC protects against brokerage failure — not investment losses due to market fluctuations.</p>

                            <h3>Can I lose money on investment apps?</h3>
                            <p>Yes, all investing involves risk. The stock market can and does go down. However, diversified index funds spread risk across hundreds of companies. Historically, the S&P 500 has returned about 10% annually over the long term, despite short-term dips. The key is to invest consistently and think long-term (5+ years).</p>

                            <h3>What's the difference between a robo-advisor and a trading app?</h3>
                            <p>Robo-advisors like Betterment automatically build and manage a diversified portfolio based on your goals. Trading apps like Webull give you control to buy and sell individual stocks yourself. Robo-advisors are better for hands-off beginners; trading apps are for those who want to learn market analysis and make their own picks.</p>

                            <h3>How much should a beginner invest?</h3>
                            <p>Start with whatever you can afford consistently — even $25/month builds the habit. A good target is 10–15% of your income for retirement. If that's not feasible, start with $50–$100/month and increase over time. The most important factor is consistency, not amount.</p>

                            <h3>Do investment apps charge fees?</h3>
                            <p>Fee structures vary widely. Webull, Public, M1 Finance, and Fidelity charge $0. Betterment charges 0.25% annually. Acorns and Stash charge $3–$12/month. On small balances, flat monthly fees can be very expensive as a percentage. Use free apps if your balance is under $5,000.</p>

                            <h3>Should I use an investment app or a traditional brokerage?</h3>
                            <p>Apps are great for beginners due to low minimums, simple interfaces, and mobile-first design. As your portfolio grows past $50,000+, consider adding a full-service brokerage like Fidelity or Schwab for broader options and advanced tools. Many investors use both.</p>
