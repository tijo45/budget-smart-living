# Phase 2 Priority Order — ROI Ranking

> **Created:** February 22, 2026  
> **Method:** Scored each article on **Search Volume × Commission Rate × Conversion Probability**  
> **Purpose:** Determine optimal writing order for maximum return on time invested

---

## ROI Scoring Model

Each article is scored on three factors (1–10 scale), then multiplied:

| Factor | What It Measures | How It's Scored |
|--------|-----------------|-----------------|
| **Volume Score** | Monthly search volume potential | 1 = <5K, 5 = 15–25K, 10 = 40K+ |
| **Commission Score** | Revenue per conversion | 1 = <$5, 5 = $20–$40, 10 = $100+ |
| **Conversion Score** | Likelihood visitor completes the affiliate action | 1 = hard sell/big commitment, 5 = moderate, 10 = free signup/quote |

**ROI Score = Volume × Commission × Conversion**

## Rankings

### 🥇 #1: How to Start a Blog That Makes Money

| Factor | Score | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| Volume | 8/10 | 30,000–50,000/mo — one of the highest-volume keywords in personal finance |
| Commission | 9/10 | Bluehost pays $65–$130 per signup; Shopify $150/sale. Among the highest individual payouts available |
| Conversion | 6/10 | Requires credit card purchase ($2.95/mo), but hosting is a low-friction buy for motivated readers. Tutorial-style content creates "follow along" momentum |
| **ROI Score** | **432** | |
| **Est. Revenue/1K visitors** | **$204** | |

**Why #1:** This single article has the potential to out-earn all other Phase 2 articles combined. Bluehost's $65–$130 payout is exceptional, and the tutorial format ("follow these steps") creates a natural buying flow — readers sign up for hosting *as part of completing the tutorial*. The high search volume (30K–50K) means even with high keyword difficulty, capturing 1–2% of that traffic yields significant returns. This is the article where writing quality and depth directly translate to more revenue.

**Risk:** High keyword difficulty (55–65). Will take 3–6 months to rank. Mitigate with long-tail secondary keywords and social promotion.

### 🥈 #2: Best Online Banks (No Fees)

| Factor | Score | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| Volume | 9/10 | 25,000–40,000/mo — highest raw search volume in our Phase 2 set |
| Commission | 7/10 | $30–$75 average per funded account (SoFi $40–$100, Ally $30–$50, Wealthfront $50–$75) |
| Conversion | 6/10 | Opening a bank account is moderate friction — free but requires personal info + deposit. Comparison format drives decisions |
| **ROI Score** | **378** | |
| **Est. Revenue/1K visitors** | **$135** | |

**Why #2:** Combines the highest search volume with strong per-conversion payouts. Online banking is a "once and done" decision — readers who click through are motivated and ready to switch. SoFi alone justifies this article with $40–$100 per funded account. The volume advantage over student loans (~2x) more than compensates for the lower per-conversion rate.

**Risk:** High keyword difficulty (50–60). Competing against NerdWallet, Bankrate. Our angle: focus on the "budget-conscious" niche within online banking — no fees, no minimums, best for building savings.

### 🥉 #3: How to Refinance Student Loans

| Factor | Score | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| Volume | 7/10 | 18,000–30,000/mo — substantial but mid-range in this group |
| Commission | 10/10 | $75–$150 per funded loan (SoFi). This is the single highest-paying affiliate vertical in personal finance |
| Conversion | 5/10 | Funded loan = highest friction action. Requires credit check, income verification, loan approval. However, visitors to this keyword have extreme intent — they've already decided to refinance |
| **ROI Score** | **350** | |
| **Est. Revenue/1K visitors** | **$120** | |

**Why #3:** The $75–$150 per conversion from SoFi is the crown jewel. Even with lower conversion rates (only ~1.5% of clickers complete a funded loan), each conversion is worth 2–10x what other articles generate. One funded SoFi refi per week = $300–$600/month from a single article. The keyword also attracts visitors with genuine financial urgency.

**Risk:** Highest keyword difficulty in the set (50–60). Student loan landscape changes with policy shifts. Conversion requires actual loan funding (longest sales cycle). Mitigate by including Credible ($15–$30/inquiry) as a lower-friction alternative — rate comparison only.

### #4: Best Investment Apps for Beginners

| Factor | Score | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| Volume | 7/10 | 20,000–30,000/mo — strong volume |
| Commission | 6/10 | $15–$50 average per funded account. Lower than banking/loans but consistent |
| Conversion | 7/10 | Many apps offer free signup or very low minimums ($1–$5). Acorns and Public make it nearly frictionless to start |
| **ROI Score** | **294** | |
| **Est. Revenue/1K visitors** | **$100** | |

**Why #4:** The conversion advantage is the story here. Investment apps compete aggressively on ease-of-signup (some require as little as $1 to start), making this a higher-converting article than student loans or online banks. Volume is strong, and the keyword bridges naturally from our existing "Investing with $100" and robo-advisors content — giving us topical authority.

**Risk:** Medium-high difficulty (45–55). Commission per conversion is moderate. Multiple strong competitors. Our edge: position as "budget investing" — the natural extension of our brand.

### #5: Best Cashback Apps

| Factor | Score | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| Volume | 8/10 | 20,000–35,000/mo — excellent volume and broad keyword cluster |
| Commission | 4/10 | $5–$15 average per signup. Lowest per-conversion in our Phase 2 set |
| Conversion | 9/10 | Free apps = near-zero friction. Downloading a free app and trying it costs the reader nothing. This is the easiest conversion in our entire content plan |
| **ROI Score** | **288** | |
| **Est. Revenue/1K visitors** | **$67** | |

**Why #5 (but publish FIRST):** Despite ranking 5th in raw ROI, this article should be **published first** because:
1. **Lowest keyword difficulty** (40–50) — fastest to rank
2. **Highest conversion rate** — free app signups convert at 5–10%, providing immediate revenue signal
3. **Strong internal linking** — connects to existing coupon apps + grocery savings articles, boosting all three
4. **Audience match** — perfectly aligned with "budget smart living" brand identity
5. **Quick win for morale** — seeing early affiliate revenue motivates continued content creation

**Risk:** Low per-conversion revenue means you need volume. At scale this works beautifully; early on, revenue will be modest ($10–$50/mo). But the article builds the internal linking web needed for higher-value articles to rank.

## Summary Table

| Rank | Article | ROI Score | Rev/1K Visitors | Difficulty | Publish Order |
|------|---------|-----------|-----------------|-----------|---------------|
| 🥇 1 | Start a Blog That Makes Money | 432 | $204 | High (55–65) | Week 7 (last) |
| 🥈 2 | Best Online Banks | 378 | $135 | High (50–60) | Week 4 |
| 🥉 3 | Refinance Student Loans | 350 | $120 | High (50–60) | Week 6 |
| 4 | Best Investment Apps | 294 | $100 | Med-High (45–55) | Week 5 |
| 5 | Best Cashback Apps | 288 | $67 | Medium (40–50) | Week 3 (first) |

> **Key insight:** ROI rank ≠ publish order. The highest-ROI articles (blog, student loans) have the hardest keywords and take longest to rank. Publishing the easier articles first builds topical authority, internal links, and site trust signals that help the harder articles rank faster when they go live.
