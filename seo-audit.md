3. **FAQ schema** — Add FAQPage structured data to articles with Q&A sections for rich snippets.

### Medium Priority

6. **Alt text** — When images are added, ensure descriptive alt attributes.
7. **URL structure** — Current structure is good (`/blog/keyword-slug.html`). Consider removing `.html` extension if possible with GitHub Pages config.

### Low Priority
8. **Social media profiles** — Add social media links to Organization schema `sameAs` array.
