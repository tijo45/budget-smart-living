**Poor Man's Stocks**

### Tagline
> *"Smart money moves on any budget."*

Alternatives for A/B testing in channel art:
- "Build wealth starting with $10"
- "Investing doesn't require a trust fund"

### Positioning Statement
Poor Man's Stocks is the YouTube channel for people who've been told they don't have enough money to invest. We teach proven, beginner-friendly investing and personal finance strategies that work with $5–$500 — no jargon, no gatekeeping, no face required.

### Target Audience
| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| Age | 18–35 (Gen Z & young millennials) |
| Income | $25K–$60K/year |
| Experience | Little to no investing experience |

| Platforms | YouTube, TikTok, Reddit (r/personalfinance, r/investing) |

### Visual Identity

| Element | Specification |
|---------|---------------|
| **Primary colors** | Forest green (#2E7D32) + charcoal (#212121) |

| **Typography** | Bold sans-serif (Montserrat Bold for thumbnails, Inter for slides) |
| **Logo concept** | Minimalist bull silhouette holding a dollar sign, or stylized "$" with an upward arrow |
| **Channel banner** | Tagline + 3 content pillars + upload schedule ("New videos Mon/Wed/Fri") |
| **Consistent avatar** | AI-generated stylized character or simple logo icon — never a real face |

### Content Pillars (4 pillars)

1. **Small-Dollar Investing (35%)** — Fractional shares, micro-investing, building portfolios from $10–$500
2. **Financial Literacy Basics (30%)** — Budgeting, saving, credit scores, debt payoff (mirrors blog content)

## 4. Thumbnail Design Guidelines

### Core Principles
1. **Readable at phone size** — must be clear at 160×90 pixels
2. **3–5 words maximum** — one core idea per thumbnail
3. **High contrast** — dark backgrounds with bright text
4. **Emotional hook** — curiosity, surprise, or aspiration
5. **Consistent branding** — always include channel green (#2E7D32) accent

### Thumbnail Template System

| Template | Use For | Layout |
|----------|---------|--------|
| **Dollar Amount** | Investment challenges, portfolio builds | Large "$100" text + arrow + result amount. Green/gold scheme. |
| **List/Number** | "Best apps," "5 mistakes" | Bold number on left + topic text on right. White on dark. |
| **Before → After** | Challenge results, transformations | Split screen with red (before) and green (after). |
| **Question Hook** | Educational explainers | Big "?" or provocative question text. Yellow accent. |

### Specific Rules
- **Text font:** Montserrat Black, 72–96pt equivalent, with slight text shadow/stroke for contrast
- **No faces** — use icons, dollar signs, phone mockups, chart graphics instead
- **Color coding:** Green = positive/gains, Red = warnings/mistakes, Gold = money/premium
- **Border/frame:** Thin green (#2E7D32) border on bottom or left for brand recognition
- **A/B test** every thumbnail — create 2 versions, swap after 48 hours based on CTR

### Tools
- **Canva Pro** — primary thumbnail creation (templates saved as brand kit)
- **Remove.bg** — for isolating stock photos if needed
- **TubeBuddy/VidIQ** — CTR tracking and A/B testing

---

## 5. Upload Schedule Recommendation

### Frequency: 3 videos per week

| Day | Content Type | Rationale |
|-----|-------------|-----------|
| **Monday 9:00 AM EST** | Evergreen educational (pillars 1–2) | Start-of-week motivation, high search traffic |
| **Wednesday 12:00 PM EST** | Challenges / real-world content (pillar 3) | Mid-week engagement peak |
| **Friday 3:00 PM EST** | Mindset / cross-promo with blog (pillar 4) | Weekend browsing, longer watch sessions |

### Why 3/week (not more, not less)
- **Algorithm:** YouTube favors consistent, frequent uploaders. 3/week signals "active creator" without burning out quality.
- **Batch production:** Scriptwriting Mon/Tue → Record Wed/Thu → Edit/publish Fri–Sun for next week. Always stay 1 week ahead.
- **Sustainable pace:** At ~4 hours per faceless video (scripting through upload), 3/week = ~12 hours/week, achievable for autonomous production.

### Shorts Strategy (supplement)
- Repurpose 30–60 second clips from each long-form video as YouTube Shorts
- Post 3–5 Shorts per week (one per long video + extras from best moments)
- Shorts drive subscriber discovery; long-form drives watch hours for YPP

### Community Tab
- Post 1 poll per week (engagement signal for algorithm)
- Share blog article links with brief commentary
- Celebrate milestones with audience

---

## 6. Cross-Promotion with Budget Smart Living

### The Flywheel: Blog → YouTube → Blog

```
Blog article (SEO traffic from Google)
  → CTA: "Watch the video explanation on YouTube"
    → YouTube video (engagement, subscribers)
      → Description links back to blog for "full written guide"
        → Blog captures email subscribers + affiliate clicks
          → Email list promotes new videos
            → Repeat
```

### Blog-to-YouTube Mapping (14 articles → video topics)

| Blog Article | YouTube Video | Cross-Link Strategy |
|---|---|---|
| How to Start Investing with $100 | Video #1 | Blog → embedded YT video; YT desc → blog link |

| Best High-Yield Savings Accounts 2026 | Video #7 | Direct topic match |
| Debt Payoff Strategies for Beginners | Video #8 | Direct topic match |
| Side Hustles That Actually Pay 2026 | Video #10 | "Invest your side hustle money" angle |

## 9. SEO & Algorithm Strategy

### Primary Keywords to Target

| Keyword | Monthly Searches (est.) | Competition | Video Mapping |
|---------|------------------------|-------------|---------------|
| "how to start investing" | 40K+ | Medium | Video #1 |
| "best investing apps" | 30K+ | High | Video #2 |
| "what is a stock" | 25K+ | Medium | Video #3 |
| "how to build credit score" | 20K+ | Medium | Video #5 |
| "investing for beginners" | 50K+ | High | Video #1, #6 |
| "high yield savings account" | 35K+ | High | Video #7 |
| "how to pay off debt" | 25K+ | Medium | Video #8 |
| "dividend investing" | 15K+ | Medium | Video #9 |
| "side hustles 2026" | 20K+ | Medium | Video #10 |

### Long-Tail Keywords (Lower competition, high intent)
- "how to invest $100 as a beginner"
- "best free investing app no minimum"
- "investing on minimum wage"
- "fractional shares for beginners"
- "build credit score from 0"
- "investing with $10 dollars"
- "poor man investing strategy"

### Algorithm Optimization Tactics

1. **Hook in first 8 seconds** — State the problem + promise the solution immediately
2. **Pattern interrupts every 60–90 seconds** — Change visual, add graphic, shift tone
3. **Optimize for 50%+ average view duration** — Keep 10-min videos watched to at least 5 min
4. **End screens + cards** — Always link to next video (increases session time)
5. **Pinned comment with question** — Drives comment engagement (algorithm signal)
6. **Post within 2 hours of upload** — Reply to every comment in the first 24 hours
7. **Timestamps in description** — Improves search ranking + enables Google "key moments"
8. **Tags:** Mix of broad ("investing") and specific ("how to invest $100 in 2026")

### YouTube Shorts Strategy
- Clip the single best 30–60 second moment from each long-form video
- Add captions (80% of Shorts are watched without sound)
- Use vertical (9:16) format
- Post 1 Short per day (5–7/week)
- Shorts drive discovery; long-form drives watch hours
