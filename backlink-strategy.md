# Backlink & Link-Building Strategy — Budget Smart Living

> **Created:** February 22, 2026  
> **Site:** https://tijo45.github.io/budget-smart-living/  
> **Goal:** Build 50+ quality backlinks in 90 days to establish domain authority in personal finance niche.

## Strategy Overview

New GitHub Pages sites start with zero domain authority. The plan focuses on **relevance over volume** — a handful of links from finance-related domains outweigh hundreds of random links. We prioritize opportunities that are (a) free, (b) accessible to new sites, and (c) in the personal finance niche.
