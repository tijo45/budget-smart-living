---

## PHASE 3: Credit Card Placeholders (Day 3+, Hardest Category)

Credit card affiliate programs are the HARDEST to get into for new sites. Strategy:

### Option A: CardRatings (Recommended for new sites)
- **What:** Aggregator that accepts smaller publishers for credit card affiliate links
- **Note:** The URL https://www.cardratings.com/affiliate-program.html returned 404 — CardRatings may have changed their program or URL
- **Alternative:** Search for "CardRatings affiliate program" or "CardRatings publisher program" to find current signup
- **Covers:** ALL credit card placeholders (`CHASE_FREEDOM_UNLIMITED`, `CHASE_FLEX`, `CITI_DOUBLE`, `AMEX_BCE`, `SAVORONE`, `WF_ACTIVE_CASH`, `DISCOVER_IT`, Blue Cash Preferred)

### Option B: Personal Refer-a-Friend Links
- If Tijo has personal Chase, Amex, Citi, or Discover cards, use their refer-a-friend programs
- These are NOT traditional affiliate programs but can earn $50-200 per approved application
- Check each card's app or website for referral link

### Option C: Informational Links (No Commission)
- As a last resort, link directly to card issuer websites with no tracking
- Still provides value to readers, builds trust, and can be upgraded later when traffic grows

---

## PHASE 4: Replace Placeholders (After Approvals — Day 5-14)

Once approved, systematically replace placeholders in the site's articles:

```
1. Log into each network dashboard
2. Search for the advertiser
3. Generate a tracked affiliate link
4. Replace the [AFFILIATE_LINK_*] placeholder in the article HTML/markdown
5. Commit and push to GitHub
6. Verify links work on the live site
```

### Special Cases
- **Vanguard (`VANGUARD`)**: NO affiliate program exists → use direct link: `https://investor.vanguard.com/` (no commission)
- **Amazon products**: Generate specific product links via Amazon Associates SiteStripe toolbar or dashboard
- **Credit cards**: Use CardRatings links or refer-a-friend until direct programs approve you

## AUTONOMY ASSESSMENT

| Action | Can Be Done Autonomously? | Why/Why Not |
|---|---|---|
| Network signups (Amazon, Impact, CJ, Awin, FlexOffers) | ❌ **NO** | Requires human identity verification, SSN/tax info, interactive CAPTCHAs, phone verification |
| Applying to individual advertisers within networks | ❌ **NO** | Requires being logged into network dashboard, clicking apply, some require additional info |
| Generating affiliate links | ❌ **NO** | Requires logged-in dashboard access |
| Replacing placeholders in site code | ✅ **YES** | Once Tijo provides the actual affiliate links, I can do find-and-replace across all articles |
| Adding FTC disclosure language | ✅ **YES** | Can add disclosure text to articles programmatically |
| Updating site and pushing to GitHub | ✅ **YES** | Can commit and push changes |
