Last month, I published eight fantasy books on Amazon KDP. Not outlines. Not drafts sitting in Google Docs. Eight completed, formatted, cover-designed, live-on-Amazon books.

Before you close this tab — no, they're not garbage. No, I didn't just paste ChatGPT output into a Word doc and hit publish. And no, I'm not here to sell you a course.

I'm here to tell you exactly what worked, what flopped, and what I'd do differently if I started over tomorrow.

## Why Fantasy? Why Eight? Why Now?

I've been writing fantasy for years — the kind of writing where you open a notebook at 11 PM, scribble three paragraphs of worldbuilding, and never look at it again. I had worlds in my head but nothing on shelves.

Then I started experimenting with AI writing tools, and something clicked. Not because the AI wrote my books for me — it didn't. But because it obliterated the bottleneck that had kept me stuck for a decade: the paralyzing gap between the idea in my head and a finished draft.

I decided to go all-in for one month. The goal: publish an entire fantasy series plus standalone titles. Here's the breakdown of what actually shipped:

- **A 5-book dark fantasy series** (each book 25,000–35,000 words)
- **2 standalone novellas** (15,000–20,000 words each)
- **1 short story collection** (12,000 words)

Total word count across all eight: roughly **185,000 words** in 30 days.

## The Tools I Actually Used

Let me be specific, because vague "I used AI" claims help nobody.

### For Writing & Drafting

**Claude** was my primary drafting partner. I used it for expanding outlines into prose, writing dialogue, and generating scene variations when I got stuck. I'd feed it a detailed scene outline — character motivations, setting details, the emotional beat I wanted to hit — and it would produce a draft I could work with.

**ChatGPT (GPT-4)** I used for brainstorming and worldbuilding. When I needed to flesh out a magic system's rules or figure out the political structure of a fictional empire, it was excellent at riffing on ideas and poking holes in my logic.

**Google Docs** for the actual manuscript assembly. Nothing fancy. I tried Scrivener and Atticus — both great tools — but for speed, I wanted zero friction.

### For Covers

**Midjourney** generated the base artwork for all eight covers. I spent serious time on prompts here — we're talking 30–50 iterations per cover to get something that looked like it belonged on a fantasy shelf and not in an AI art gallery.

**Canva Pro** for typography, layout, and finalizing the covers to KDP's specifications. The spine width calculator became my best friend.

### For Formatting & Publishing

**Atticus** for ebook and paperback formatting. Worth every penny. It handles front matter, back matter, chapter headings, and exports clean files that KDP accepts without complaints.

**Amazon KDP** for publishing (obviously). I also set up paperback editions for all eight — the margins on paperback are slim, but having a physical edition adds legitimacy.

## My Actual Daily Process

Here's what a typical day looked like during the sprint:

**Morning (2 hours): Outline and plan.** I'd map out 3–5 scenes for the day. Each scene got a mini-brief: what happens, who's there, what the reader should feel, and how it connects to the next scene. This was the most important step. Bad outlines produce bad drafts, AI or not.

**Midday (3–4 hours): Draft with AI assistance.** I'd take each scene brief and work through it with Claude. My process was iterative — generate a draft, read it, identify what felt flat or off-character, revise the prompt, regenerate specific sections. I was not copy-pasting raw output. I was directing, editing, and rewriting constantly.

**Evening (2 hours): Edit and polish.** This is where the book became *mine*. I'd read through the day's output, rewrite transitions, fix voice inconsistencies, add sensory details the AI missed, and cut anything that felt generic. AI is remarkably bad at writing smell and taste — it defaults to the same descriptors. I had to manually add the grit.

**Total daily commitment: 7–9 hours.** This was not passive. This was a full-time job for a month.

## What Actually Worked

### 1. Detailed Outlines Changed Everything

The single biggest factor in quality was how much work I put in *before* the AI touched anything. When I gave Claude a vague prompt like "write a scene where the hero enters the dark forest," I got generic fantasy slop. When I gave it:

> "Kael enters the Thornwood at dusk. He's tracking blood from a wounded stag, but the blood trail splits into three directions — which shouldn't be possible. He's already anxious because the last person who entered the Thornwood was his sister, six months ago. The trees here grow in spirals. There's no wind but the branches move. He hears his sister's laugh, but it's coming from underground."

...I got something I could actually work with.

**Lesson: AI amplifies your preparation. Garbage in, garbage out is not a cliché — it's the entire game.**

### 2. Series Writing Is the Sweet Spot

Once I had the world, magic system, and characters established in the first book, books 2–5 moved significantly faster. I maintained a "series bible" document that I'd reference (and feed to the AI) with every session. Character voice, world rules, plot threads — all documented.

Books 1 took me about 6 days. Book 5 took me 3.

### 3. Covers Make or Break You

I spent more time on covers than I expected — roughly 15–20 hours across all eight books. But it paid off. Fantasy readers judge covers *hard*. A cover that looks AI-generated (the telltale smooth skin, weird lighting, extra fingers) will tank your click-through rate before anyone reads your blurb.

My approach: generate the base image in Midjourney, then use Canva to add professional typography and compositional elements that make it look designed, not generated.

### 4. KDP Categories and Keywords Matter More Than You Think

I spent a full day just researching categories and keywords using Publisher Rocket. Picking the right subcategories — like "Dark Fantasy" vs. "Epic Fantasy" vs. "Sword & Sorcery" — determines who sees your book. I found subcategories with decent traffic but lower competition, which gave my books visibility they wouldn't have gotten in broader categories.

## What Didn't Work

### 1. First Drafts Without Heavy Editing

Early on, I tried to save time by doing lighter editing passes. The result was prose that felt... fine. Competent. But soulless. Readers can tell. I got my first negative review on a book where I'd rushed the editing: "reads like it was written by a machine." That stung, and it was fair.

After that, I committed to rewriting at least 30–40% of every AI-assisted draft. The final product needs your fingerprints all over it.

### 2. Rapid-Fire Publishing Without a Launch Strategy

I published my first three books in the first two weeks and did basically zero marketing. No email list, no social media push, no ARC readers. The books just... sat there. It wasn't until I slowed down and set up a basic launch sequence (a small ARC team, some BookTok engagement, and Amazon ads at $5/day) that I started seeing movement.

### 3. Trying to Write Outside My Genre Knowledge

One of my standalones was a fantasy romance — a subgenre I read occasionally but don't live in. Readers of fantasy romance have *very* specific expectations about pacing, tropes, and heat level. My book didn't deliver on those expectations, and the reviews reflected that. Write what you know, or at minimum, do deep research into genre conventions before you start.

## The Numbers (Honest Ones)

After one month of the books being live:

- **Total revenue:** ~$340 (mostly Kindle Unlimited page reads)
- **Total pages read (KENP):** ~72,000
- **Best-performing book:** Book 1 of the series ($95 in its first month)
- **Worst-performing book:** The fantasy romance standalone ($12)
- **Total spent on tools/ads:** ~$180 (Midjourney, Canva Pro, Publisher Rocket, Amazon ads)
- **Net profit:** ~$160

That's not quit-your-job money. I know. But here's the thing — these books will continue to earn. The series is building momentum. I'm running low-budget ads. And I now have a *backlist*, which is the real asset in self-publishing.

---

## What I'd Do Differently

1. **Build the email list first.** Even a small list of 200 fantasy readers would have made launch week dramatically better.
2. **Write the full series before publishing Book 1.** Rapid release is king on KDP. If I'd had all five books ready and released them weekly, the algorithm would have pushed them harder.
3. **Invest in a professional cover for Book 1.** AI-generated covers are good enough for most of the series, but Book 1 is your storefront. A $150–$300 professional cover would have been worth it.
4. **Spend more time on the blurbs.** I rushed my book descriptions. They're the second most important sales tool after covers, and mine were mid.

## The Uncomfortable Truth About AI-Assisted Publishing

Here it is: **AI doesn't replace the writer. It replaces the blank page.**

The books I'm proudest of are the ones where I put in the most creative work — the outlining, the worldbuilding, the character development, the agonizing over whether a scene earns its emotional beat. The AI helped me get from outline to draft faster than I ever could alone, but the quality ceiling was always determined by my effort, not the tool's capability.

If you're thinking about doing this, know that it's real work. It's not a hack. It's not passive income. It's a different workflow for producing books, and it demands just as much creative energy as traditional writing — it just redirects that energy from "staring at a blank page" to "directing and refining."

I published eight books in a month. I'm proud of most of them. I'm already outlining the next series.

If you've got worlds in your head that have been stuck there for years — this might be the thing that finally gets them out.
